#Objectives
#1.Permanently save the changes done in a transaction
#2.Undo the transaction that has not been saved

#Introduction: ACID Transactions
#A transaction is simply a sequence of operations performed using one or more SQL statements as a single logical unit of work. A database transaction must be ACID (Atomic, Consistent, Isolated and Durable). The effects of all the SQL statements in a transaction can either be applied to the database using the COMMIT command or undone from the database using the ROLLBACK command.
#In this project, we will utilize some commonly used TCL (Transaction Control Language) commands of SQL through the creation of a stored procedure routine. We will use COMMIT statement, which is used to permanently save the changes done in the transactions in a table, and ROLLBACK statement, which is used to undo the transactions that have not been saved in a table. ROLLBACK can only be used to undo the changes in the current unit of work.

CREATE TABLE BankAccounts (
    AccountNumber VARCHAR(5) NOT NULL,
    AccountName VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL,

#Scenario1: Rose is buying a pair of boots from ShoeShop. So we have to update Rose's balance as well as the ShoeShop balance in the BankAccounts table. Then we also have to update Boots stock in the ShoeShop table. After Boots, let's also attempt to buy Rose a pair of Trainers.
#Once the tables are ready, create a stored procedure routine named TRANSACTION_ROSE that includes TCL commands like COMMIT and ROLLBACK.

#Scenario2:
# Create a stored procedure TRANSACTION_JAMES to execute a transaction based on the following scenario: First buy James 4 pairs of Trainers from ShoeShop. Update his balance as well as the balance of ShoeShop. Also, update the stock of Trainers at ShoeShop. 
#Then attempt to buy James a pair of Brogues from ShoeShop. If any of the UPDATE statements fail, the whole transaction fails. You will roll back the transaction. Commit the transaction only if the whole transaction is successful.
